Networking SFC
    Service Function Chaining is a mechanism for overriding
    the basic destination based forwarding that is typical
    of IP networks. It is conceptually related to Policy
    Based Routing in physical networks but it is typically
    thought of as a Software Defined Networking technology.
    It is often used in conjunction with security functions
    although it may be used for a broader range of features.
    Fundamentally SFC is the ability to cause network packet
    flows to route through a network via a path other than
    the one that would be chosen by routing table lookups
    on the packet's destination IP address. It is most
    commonly used in conjunction with Network Function
    Virtualization when recreating in a virtual environment
    a series of network functions that would have
    traditionally been implemented as a collection of
    physical network devices connected in series by cables.
